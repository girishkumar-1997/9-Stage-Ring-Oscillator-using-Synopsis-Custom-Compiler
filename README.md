## Abstract

An Oscillator generates a signal with specific frequency and which is used for synchronizing the computational process in digital systems. In this project we design and do analysis of ring oscillator using 28nm technology. Ring oscillator is basically a device consisting of odd number of inverters connected in series with positive feedback. It’s output oscillates between two voltage levels either 1 or zero.

# Introduction

Ring oscillator is a type of relaxation oscillator containing odd number of inverters. The output of last inverter is connected to the first inverter which is positive feedback. The number of inverter stages depends on the frequency which we want to generate. There will be a delay due to inverter and as the stages increases the oscillator frequency will be reduced.

# Tools

- Synopsys Custom Compiler:  The Synopsys Custom Compiler™ design environment is a modern solution for full-custom analog, custom digital, and mixed-signal IC design. As the heart of the Synopsys Custom Design Platform, Custom Compiler provides design entry, simulation management and analysis, and custom layout editing features. This tool was used to design the circuit on a transistor level.

- Synopsys Primewave:  PrimeWave™ Design Environment is a comprehensive and flexible environment for simulation setup and analysis of analog, RF, mixed-signal design, custom-digital and memory designs within the Synopsys Custom Design Platform. This tool helped in various types of simulations of the above designed circuit.

- Synopsys 28nm PDK:  The Synopsys 28nm Process Design Kit(PDK) was used in creation and simulation of the above designed circuit.
